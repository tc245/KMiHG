    "Introduction\n",
    "---\n",
    "In this introductory practical exercise we are going to introduce ourselves to the very basics of computer programming, skills which are essential in modern data analysis at any level. Up to now, most of you will have completed statistical analysis using tools like Microsoft Excel (e.g. in the fundamental methods course in year 1). This involved using what we call a \"Graphical User Interface\" or a GUI and pointing and clicking on menu items to complete your analysis. However, this is a very inefficient way of doing statistical analysis, particularly when your analysis starts to get even moderately complex and involving multiple steps. For example, what happens if after completing your analysis you realise you have made a mistake in an earlier step, perhaps you make an error when typing data into your spreadsheet? You would then have to rectify the mistake and repeat all of the steps all over again. What if instead, it was possible to write out your analysis steps using computer code? This would mean your entire analysis would be contained within a \"script\" that could be run by the computer multiple times. So, if you did make a mistake in an earlier step, all you would need to do is locate the error in your script, make the change and then run the script again to reproduce the analysis. This is a much more efficient way of working! Of course, this also means we need to learn the \"language\" of the program we are using in order to write the code. This is where noteable and jupyter notebooks come in...\n",

    "What is a Jupyter Notebook?!\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a moment to get familiarised with what a Jupyter Notebook actually is! First and foremost, the Jupyter Notebook is an interactive environment for writing and running computer programming code. Typically, these notebooks run in the \"cloud\" (i.e. on a remote computer somewhere which you access via the internet and a web browser). The University of Edinburgh runs its own Jupyter Notebook platform called \"Noteable\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are capable of running code in a wide range of languages. Each notebook runs a particular \"kernel\" and is associated with a single language. What is a kernel I hear you ask? Think of the kernel basically as the \"computer\", the thing that is going to \"interpret\" the code script you send to it and carry out the relevant commands. The notebooks we are using are running the \"R\" statistical analysis software, therefore it interprets and runs R commands and code. R is fast becoming the default statistical analysis software in industry and graduates with R skills are becoming highly sought after. R is also free and does not require a licence so you are free to continue using it after you leave university! \n",
    "\n",
    "The main feature of the notebooks themselves is that they contain both interactive elements (where you run code and see the results) and traditional textbook or instructions material in one place (no more switching between a word document with instructions and the actual software!). They are primarily organised around \"cells\". A cell can be a \"Markdown\" type of cell which contains text or instructions (like this one). Or it can be a \"code\" cell which contains the raw computer code. When you \"run\" or \"execute\" a code cell the commands in the cell are sent to the computer to be interpreted and then run. The computer then sends back the result which will be displayed as output below the cell. Lets try out running some code with a classic first example...\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Hello World!\"\n",
    "---\n",
    "When programmers first start learning to code (as you are!) including learning a new language, we tend to write a one-line program that prints some version of the message \"Hello world!\". This has become a bit of a tradition among programmers and developers! It is a simple program that shows whether your computer is properly set up.\n",
    "\n",
    "So lets do that. Copy and paste the code below into the the cell below. Then run the code by using either `Shift-Enter` or pressing the \"run\"  button in the toolbar above:\n",
    "\n",

This will allow you to save a copy of the notebook with a new filename so that if you ever want to return to the original notebook you can. <b>When you do this, a box will pop up with `KMiHG.git/Week6/` written in it. Delete all of this text and just write whatever you want to call your notebook in the box and click `save`.</b>\n",
